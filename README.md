## Project Descritpion 

This project is a replica of a dashboard I was building for work, in real life example I worked with different datasets provided by different teams in then company to build an internal tool. Original data was stored on BigQuery, created a combined table on Sheets and presented the final data on and Looker Studio.

Here, I created a mock version of similar data with 5 made up customers and 3 products, to show a similar process to the creation of dashbaord.
